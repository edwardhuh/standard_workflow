# standard_workflow

I will be replicating the hypermodern python workflow as described by CLAUDIO JOLOWICZ in the following blog article:
https://cjolowicz.github.io/posts/hypermodern-python-01-setup/

This is a side project solely for my own edification. 

Notes to myself as I work my way through this project:
TOML := Tomâ€™s Obvious, Minimal Language
A data serialisation language designed to be minimal configuraation file format that's easy to read due to obvious semantics. Used as alternative to YAML and JSON as an unambigious hash table. 
The official github (https://github.com/toml-lang/toml)
But, my personal favorite is (https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/toml/)
